    <h5 class="text-black">COOKIES</h5>

    <p>To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Website for our Users, we may utilise “cookies” and other tracking technologies. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about your activity on our Website. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by you.</p>

    <p>All cookies (other than Strictly Necessary cookies) require User consent. Subject to your preferences, we use the following cookies:</p>
    <p><b class="text-black">Strictly Necessary cookies.</b> These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Website, use a shopping cart, or make use of e-billing services.</p>
    <p><b class="text-black">Analytical or Performance cookies.</b> These allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.</p>
    <p><b class="text-black">Functionality cookies.</b>These are used to recognise you when you return to our Website. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).</p>
    <p><b class="text-black">Targeting cookies.</b>These cookies record your visit to our Website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our Website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.</p>
    <p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you may need to re-enter your original User Profile ID, user name and password to gain access to certain parts of our Website.</p>
    <h5 class="text-black">DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION?</h5>
    <p>We may disclose your Personal Information to the following types of third parties:</p>
    <p>vendors and contractors who are performing services on our behalf to enable uses of the information we have described above;</p>
    <p>our external consultants who assist with the development and delivery of our services;</p>

    <p>companies who assist with our marketing, customer surveys, and feedback tools</p>

    <p>in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets we may be required to disclose certain of your Personal Information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; or</p>
    <p>in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements or in respect of other legal claims.</p>
    <p>We do not sell any Personal Information of Users. We may provide aggregated and anonymised information to our sponsors and partners but this does not include Personal Information and you will not be identifiable. We may provide additional Personal Information to our sponsors and partners where you have consented to that sharing.</p>
    <p>When we use third parties to assist us in processing your Personal Information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy, applicable privacy laws, and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
    <p>If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information, we may transfer that Personal Information from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. Your Personal Information may be collected and stored on servers located in the territory of India and such other countries as we may disclose from time to time. If we transfer your Personal Information to another country, we will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that appropriate safeguards are implemented, to the extent required by the applicable privacy laws. Please contact us using the details set out below if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Information.</p>
    <h5 class="text-black">CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</h5>
    <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and, once we receive it, for storage and disposal. When you enter Personal Information on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). All information we gather is securely stored within databases controlled by us. The databases are stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited.</p>
    <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use generally acceptable industry means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    <p>We limit access to Personal Information to employees/personnel who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</p>
    <p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access to your User Profile or the Rewards Program on our Website or other products and services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
    <h5 class="text-black">THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h5>
    <p>This Privacy Policy only applies to our Website. If you click on a link to a third-party site or otherwise leave the Website you will go to a website that is outside our control. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your Personal Information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as we do. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other website and/or service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third-party website that is linked to our Website, you should consult that website’s privacy policy before providing any Personal Information.</p>
    <h5 class="text-black">HOW LONG WILL WE KEEP YOUR DATA?</h5>
    <p>We will keep your data for as long as required in connection with the original purpose for which that data was collected (e.g. where you are still happy to hear from us about our latest news and services).</p>
    <p>Once you no longer wish to be engaged with us we may still need to keep hold of your data if there is a legal reason for doing so (e.g. for tax purposes or where we are resolving a dispute with you), but we will only retain the data which is strictly necessary for such reason and thereafter, will remove this data from our systems.</p>
    <h5 class="text-black">YOUR RIGHTS</h5>
    <p>We will provide you with the rights granted to you under applicable privacy laws, but these rights may differ depending on where you are.</p>
    <p>For example, if you are in the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area, you may be entitled to various rights under the applicable privacy laws which entitle you, in certain circumstances, to:</p>
    <p>ask us for a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you;</p>
    <p>correct or update your Personal Information, which you can do yourself by logging into your account (if relevant) or if you would prefer, please contact us and we can assist;</p>
    <p>request that we delete your Personal Information;</p>
    <p>object to the handling of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (as set out in the above table);</p>
    <p>restrict the processing of your Personal Information;</p>
    <p>request the transfer of your Personal Information (or some of it) to a third-party service provider; or </p>
    <p>where you have provided your consent for something, in certain circumstances, you may withdraw this consent (but note that we may continue to use your Personal Information if we have legal grounds for doing so).</p>
    <p>If you are in Australia, you can:</p>
    <p>ask us for a copy of the Personal Information we hold about;</p>
        <p>correct or update your Personal Information, which you can do yourself by logging into your account (if relevant) or if you would prefer, please contact us and we can assist.</p>
    <p>The Australian Privacy Principles set out the circumstances when we can refuse those requests. If we do refuse your request, we will provide you with a written notice that sets out the reasons (unless it would be unreasonable to provide them to you). Subject to our right to refuse access, we will provide you with a report that lists any Personal Information that we may hold about you.</p>
    <p>If you live in California, you may also be entitled to rights to access specific types of Personal Information, to request its deletion, and not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights.</p>
    <p>All Users have the right to correction of inaccurate data.</p>
    <p>Please contact us if you would like to exercise your rights, which most of the time you can do for free. In some circumstances, applicable privacy laws allow us to charge a fee or to refuse your request. If we wish to charge a fee or refuse your request, we will inform you in writing and set out the reasons. Otherwise, we will always respond within one month (unless there is a legal reason for us to take longer).</p>
    <p>If it is not clear to us who is making the request, we may ask you to confirm your identity before we proceed.</p>
    <p>You may also contact the data protection authority where you live if you have any concerns about the way we are handling your Personal Information. However, where possible, please speak to us first as we would appreciate the opportunity to help with your concern.</p>
    <h5 class="text-black">Contact Us</h5>
